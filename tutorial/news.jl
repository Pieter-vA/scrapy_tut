REUTERS/Tingshu Wang/File Photo WASHINGTON, July 19 (Reuters) - Four Chinese nationals have been charged in a global hacking campaign aimed at dozens of companies, universities and government agencies in the United States and abroad, the U.S. Justice Department said on Monday. The charges were announced as the United States and a coalition of allies on Monday accused China's Ministry of State Security of a global cyber hacking campaign, specifically attributing a large Microsoft attack disclosed earlier this year to hackers working on Beijing's behalf.  The hacking was sponsored by the Ministry of State Security and focused on information that would significantly benefit Chinese companies and businesses, including research and development processes, according to the indictment cited by the Justice Department. Reaction from the defendants was not immediately available. The defendants and officials in the Hainan State Security Department (HSSS) tried to hide the Chinese government's role in the information theft by using a front company, according to the indictment, which was returned in May and unsealed Friday. The campaign targeted trade secrets in industries including aviation, defense, education, government, health care, biopharmaceutical and maritime industries, according to a Justice Department statement. Victims were in Austria, Cambodia, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Malaysia, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. \"These criminal charges once again highlight that China continues to use cyber-enabled attacks to steal what other countries make, in flagrant disregard of its bilateral and multilateral commitments,\" Deputy U.S. Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in the statement. It said the two-count indictment alleges that Ding Xiaoyang, Cheng Qingmin and Zhu Yunmin were HSSD officers responsible for coordinating computer hackers and linguists at the front companies. The fourth defendant, Wu Shurong, an employee at front company Hainan Xiandun Technology Development Co. Ltd., \"created malware, hacked into computer systems operated by foreign governments, companies and universities, and supervised other Hainan Xiandun hackers,\" the Justice Department said.

{"title": "After $27.7 bln deal, Salesforce aims to connect companies via Slack", "text": "Smartphone with Slack logo stands in a shopping cart on a keyboard in front of displayed Salesforce logo in this picture illustration taken December 1, 2020. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo July 21 (Reuters) - Business software maker Salesforce.com   on Wednesday closed its $27.7 billion purchase of Slack Technologies Inc  , a massive bet that Slack's workplace app will become popular for collaborations within and between companies. U.S. antitrust regulators cleared the deal this week, allowing the creation of a stronger challenger to Microsoft Corp  , the top workplace software provider whose Teams app competes with Slack for market dominance. The merger partners hope the deal will bolster efforts to connect their joint customers to smooth out common business deals, Salesforce President Bret Taylor and Slack Chief Executive Stewart Butterfield said in an interview on Wednesday. They also want to reduce the complexity of using hundreds of different cloud-based apps that have crept into workplaces, they added. For example, a Slack \"channel\" can be created to replace all the emails, phone calls and video conferences that might otherwise occur between a sales team doing a deal with a procurement team at another company. Thousands of apps work with Slack, so documents from third-party platforms like Google Drive can be signed in the channel with services like DocuSign Inc  , Taylor said. \"We did the due diligence for the Slack acquisition in Slack,\" Taylor noted. \"I joked it had the highest billable hours of any channel ever, because we had all the lawyers in there and the investment banks,\" he said, but \"it was really a transformative experience.\" While analysts view Teams as Slack's largest rival, Butterfield said Slack will continue to integrate with the Microsoft app in line with its goal to make it easier for employees to get things done. \"What customers want is interoperability. They don't want to have to make hard choices,\" Butterfield said. \"We'll integrate with everyone - Microsoft and Salesforce, of course, but also ServiceNow and Workday, and more or less anyone you can think of.\" Our Standards:  Subscribe for our daily curated newsletter to receive the latest exclusive Reuters coverage delivered to your inbox.

REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page. WASHINGTON, July 9 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday dismissed Amazon.com's legal challenge to the Defense Department's2019 decision to award a $10 billion JEDI cloud-computing project to rival Microsoft Corp   after the Pentagon canceled the contract. Amazon.com had accused then-President Donald Trump, alleging that the former president exerted improper pressure on military officials to steer the contract away from Amazon. The Pentagon said on Tuesday it expected the new multi-billion dollar contract would be split between Amazon and Microsoft. Amazon did not object to dismissing its 2019 lawsuit. Judge Patricia E. Campbell-Smith of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims agreed to dismiss the lawsuit at the government's request, saying the case was now moot. Trump publicly derided then-Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and repeatedly criticized the company. Amazon had sought to question Trump about his role in the contract decision. The Pentagon hopes to have the first awards by April 2022 for its new Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability (JWCC). John Sherman, acting chief information officer for the Defense Department, said on Tuesday he expects both Microsoft and Amazon will get cloud contracts. Microsoft said in a statement that the company was confident it will \"continue to be successful as the DoD selects partners for new work.\" Amazon's Amazon Web Services cloud unit said it agreed with the Pentagon's decision to cancel the contract. It said the initial award was \"not based on the merits of the proposals and instead was the result of outside influence that has no place in government procurement.\" In April, Campbell-Smith refused to dismiss Amazon's claims alleging the Trump administration interfered in the Pentagon's award to Microsoft after putting it on hold indefinitely in February 2020. The now-canceled Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud (JEDI) contract was budgeted for as much as $10 billion and was part of a broader digital modernization of the Pentagon aimed at making it more technologically agile.

{"title": "Microsoft to offer cloud-based version of Windows operating system", "text": "A Microsoft logo is seen in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 14, 2016. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson July 14 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp   on Wednesday said it will offer its Windows operating system as a cloud-based service, aiming to make it easier to access business apps that need Windows from a broader range of devices. Windows 365, as the service will be called, will roll out on Aug. 2 and will work somewhat like buying a new Windows PC: A business or school will pick how much computing power, memory and storage they would like for an the new machine. But instead of waiting for a physical machine to arrive in the mail, the employee or student will access the operating system in the cloud via an existing PC, a Mac, iPhone, Android phone or Chromebook, as long as it has a web browser compatible with HTML 5, a widely used internet standard. The cloud-based version was created in response to feedback from clients who wanted employees and students to have quicker and easier PC access regardless of physical location. \"We define that shift to hybrid work as really being flexibility in how, when and where you work. That's really the pattern that we're seeing develop all across the world as people are starting to experiment,\" said Jared Spataro, corporate vice president for Microsoft 365 software. The service is akin to so-called \"virtual\" and \"remote\" desktops that have been around for decades but which require a sophisticated IT department to set up and manage. Those costs can also be unpredictable because they are based on how much the desktops are used. Microsoft hopes the Windows 365 technology will be easy enough for small-business owners or smaller schools to introduce  without a large IT department, with a predictable monthly bill based on the size of each virtual computer. Andrew Hewitt, an analyst at Forrester Research, said the move would help Microsoft defend its dominant market share in the face of strong competition from operating systems from Apple Inc   and Alphabet's Google   that are easier for schools and businesses to manage.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo July 27 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp   posted its most profitable quarter on Tuesday, beating Wall Street expectations for revenue and earnings, as PC sales declines stemming from a global chip shortage were more than made up for by a boom in cloud services. Shares ticked up 0.7% after Microsoft projected that growth in its Azure cloud computing business will continue apace following a quarter in which sales climbed 51%. Overall revenue rose 21% to $46.2 billion, beating analysts' consensus by about $2 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The pandemic-driven shift to remote work has boosted consumer appetite for cloud-based computing, helping companies including Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc's   cloud unit and Alphabet Inc's   Google Cloud. Microsoft's \"guidance was off-the-charts strong and it shows the cloud growth story in Redmond is hitting its next gear,\" said Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities. Revenue in Microsoft's \"Intelligent Cloud\" segment rose 30% to $17.4 billion, with growth in Azure revenues handily surpassing the 43.1% jump projected by analysts, according to consensus data from Visible Alpha. Microsoft's market capitalization stands at nearly $2.2 trillion, after climbing nearly 30% so far this year, compared with 18% for the overall S&P 500 Index  , according to Refinitiv Eikon data based on Monday's closing price. It has surpassed the price-to-earnings ratios of tech titans Apple Inc    and Google, fueling concerns among some analysts that it may be overvalued. \"Microsoft's stock has made a big run since the beginning of the pandemic, and is trading at rich multiples,\" said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing.com. \"After such a powerful rally, its shares may take a breather, especially when investors are still unclear how the demand scenario will evolve in the post-pandemic environment.\" Revenue from personal computing, which includes Windows software and Xbox gaming consoles, rose 9% to $14.1 billion. But Xbox content and services revenue dipped, suggesting that a pandemic-fueled gaming boom is beginning to wane, said Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight. The company must strengthen its presence in the home to better compete with rivals, he added. As makers of cars to smartphones grapple with an unprecedented chip shortage, Microsoft has not been immune. \"OEM revenue declined 3% and Surface declined 20%,\" Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said on a call with analysts. She added that \"both were impacted by the significant supply constraints noted earlier in a good demand environment.\" The chip shortage could also be contributing to Microsoft's dip in Xbox content and services revenue, as constrained hardware sales lead to a weaker performance in services, Ives said. \"If there's any lagging part of Microsoft, it's the consumer piece,\" he said. \"I think that continues to be a work in progress.\" Microsoft projected strong growth for professional social network LinkedIn, which benefited during the quarter from robust advertising and a strengthening job market. The company reported earnings of $2.17 per share, above the consensus estimate of $1.92.

The search and advertising giant had asked the judge to compel Microsoft to turn over documents, citing its failure to comply with a subpoena, according to a court filing unsealed late Thursday. \"In terms of does this request meet the general definition of relevancy? The answer is yes,\" said Judge Amit Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia at a hearing on Friday. Google served a subpoena to Microsoft more than three months ago, seeking documents regarding Microsoft's Bing search engine as well as its Internet Explorer and Edge but has not received them, the filing said. Google says some of the documents might shed light on whether Microsoft was actually restrained from competing with Google, or whether it simply failed to compete successfully. \"In particular, there are nineteen Microsoft employees who held important positions relating to activities at the core of this case but whose files Microsoft refuses to commit to search at this time,\" Google said in the filing. Google's search engine is the market leader by far while Bing's share is in single digits. Google also has a browser, Chrome. Microsoft, also in a filing late on Thursday, said Google's additional requests brings the total number of custodians, whose files Microsoft will have to search, to 55. According to Google, these executives covered issues at the core of the case, including the development and distribution of Microsoft's various search engines, Microsoft's search advertising business, and Microsoft's effort to market devices that would give it more search access points beyond the Windows desktop.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst WASHINGTON, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Vice President Kamala Harris underscored the importance of affordable childcare for improving U.S. competitiveness during a meeting with top executives of seven companies including Microsoft Corp   and Etsy   on Thursday. Harris - seeking to build support for a $3.5 trillion measure that tackles childcare, climate, healthcare and other Biden administration priorities - said the business leaders had shown that providing child care and paid leave boosted productivity and aided their recruiting efforts. The meeting, which included the heads of AirBnB Inc  , Gap Inc  , Chobani, Seventh Generation and Patagonia, is part of the Biden administration's push to ensure passage of the new legislation, whose mammoth size has already caused divisions among even some Democrats. Affordable child care \"when we prioritize it as a nation, contributes to our ability to be competitive globally,\" Harris said, adding it also had a direct impact on recruitment, retention, worker productivity, and corporate profits. The White House said the companies participating in the meeting supported child care and paid leave policies. Harris said Build Back Better, Biden's agenda for the U.S. economy's post-pandemic recovery, was aimed at lowering costs for families, helping businesses and strengthening the economy, while addressing longstanding \"fissures and failures\" in American society. Economists estimate that lack of access to family-friendly policies, such as child care and paid parental leave, explains nearly a third of the decline in U.S. women\u2019s labor force participation relative to other OECD countries. Nearly 2 million women left the labor force during the COVID-19 pandemic to care for children and elderly relatives, and many have not yet returned to work. On Wednesday, Biden met with business and education leaders including the heads of United Airlines   and healthcare provider Kaiser Permanente to discuss efforts to address ways to get more people vaccinated against COVID-19. The coronavirus has upended the economy and killed more than 617,000 people nationwide.  Businesses have in general struggled to hire workers during the pandemic for various reasons, though unemployment has fallen after spiking last year amid widespread shutdowns.  After passing a $1.9 trillion coronavirus-related rescue plan into law in March, Democrats are now pushing the $3.5 trillion measure, which includes $726 billion for universal preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds and child care for working families, and aids caregivers of the elderly and disabled. \"When workers don\u2019t have adequate care for their families, that can translate to lower productivity, increased absenteeism, and higher turnover \u2013 all hurting the bottom line for businesses,\" a White House official said, adding that a separate coalition of more than 275 businesses had backed the child care proposal.

June 15, 2020. REUTERS/Tom Brenner July 17 (Reuters) - Some U.S. tech companies expressed disappointment with a ruling by a federal judge that blocked new applications to a program that protects immigrants who were brought to the United States as children from deportation. U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen on Friday sided with a group of states suing to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, arguing that it was illegally created by former President Barack Obama in 2012.  \"We have long argued in support of this program, filing an amicus brief in this case, and we are very disappointed by the decision (from the judge)\", Google   spokesperson Jose Castaneda said. \"Dreamers and immigrants make the United States \u2014 and Twitter \u2014 better\", a spokesperson from social media platform Twitter   said in an emailed statement. Twitter, Google, Microsoft  and Photoshop maker Adobe   urged the U.S. Congress to come together to protect Dreamers, with Google saying they wanted DACA to be \"cemented\" into law. Microsoft President Brad Smith said that the \"disappointing\" ruling created \"uncertainty yet again for Dreamers.\" The judge ruled on Friday that the program violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) when it was created but said that since there were so many people currently enrolled in the program - nearly 650,000 - his ruling would be temporarily stayed for their cases and their renewal applications. Biden, who was vice president when Obama created the program, has said he wants to create a permanent pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients, known as \"Dreamers.\" On Saturday, Biden vowed to preserve the program that protects from deportation hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, promising to appeal the judge's ruling invalidating it and urging Congress to provide a path to citizenship.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Aug 4 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge said Microsoft Corp's   LinkedIn must face a lawsuit claiming it inflated the number of people who watched video ads on the networking platform, allowing it to overcharge hundreds of thousands of advertisers. U.S. Magistrate Judge Susan van Keulen, however, on Tuesday dismissed fraud-based claims and an unfair competition claim, saying the plaintiff advertisers did not show that LinkedIn made specific misrepresentations or that its conduct hurt the public at large. But the San Jose, California-based judge let the advertisers pursue claims based on the theory that bot traffic, errant clicks and fraudulent clicks inflated the metrics they relied on when buying LinkedIn ads. Led by TopDevz Inc and Noirefy Inc,the advertisers said LinkedIn had been counting video ad \"views\" from users' LinkedIn apps, even when the videos were playing only off-screen because users had scrolled past them. LinkedIn said in an email on Wednesday it looked forward to showing the claims lacked merit and said it was \"committed to the transparency and integrity of our ads products.\" Warren Postman, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an email he was pleased with the decision and looked forward to proving that LinkedIn broke the law. Van Keulen said the plaintiffs could try to pursue their dismissed claims again. The advertisers sued after   said on Nov. 12 that its engineers had three months earlier found and then fixed software bugs that may have led to more than 418,000 overcharges. LinkedIn said more than 90% of the overcharges were less than $25, and that it provided credits to virtually all affected advertisers. In their lawsuit, the advertisers said the overcharges left them with less money to spend elsewhere, including on ads. They are seeking unspecified damages and restitution.

REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol WASHINGTON, July 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. Defense Department dealt a blow to Microsoft Corp   on Tuesday when the Pentagon announced it was scrapping the Trump-era award of a $10 billion JEDI cloud-computing project. The government will hold a new round of bids and allow multiple companies to compete, including rival Amazon.com  .  In November 2019, Microsoft beat favorite Amazon for the contract, called the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud, or JEDI, which is part of a broad modernization of the Pentagon's information technology systems. Here is a timeline of important dates leading up to the award: JULY 26, 2018: The Pentagon released the final request for proposals, seeking a single winner to allow for the most rapid adoption of the technology. The contract, valued at $10 billion over 10 years, was set to be awarded in September. AUG. 6, 2018: Oracle Corp   filed a protest with the Defense Department over its plans to award the contract to a single company instead of allowing for multiple winners, arguing that the Pentagon would be locked into a legacy contract for a decade or more. OCT. 8, 2018: Alphabet Inc's   Google said it was no longer vying for the contract, in part because the company's new ethical guidelines did not align with the project, without elaborating. NOV. 14, 2018: The Government Accountability Office denied the protest filed by Oracle, finding that the agency \"reasonably\" determined that the single-award approach was in the government's best interests for reasons including national security concerns and complied with applicable law. APRIL 26, 2019: Amazon and Microsoft were selected to continue competing for the contract. JULY 19, 2019: Four Republican members of U.S. Congress, including House Armed Services Committee ranking member Mac Thornberry, sent a letter to Trump urging him to move forward with the $10 billion cloud contract. AUG. 1, 2019: The Pentagon decided to put on hold its decision to award the $10 billion cloud-computing contract after Trump said his administration was examining Amazon's bid following complaints from other technology companies. OCT. 25, 2019: The Defense Department said that Microsoft won the contract. NOV. 14, 2019: Amazon said it is contesting the Pentagon's award to Microsoft, expressing concern that politics got in the way of a fair contracting process. NOV. 15, 2019: U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper rejected any suggestion of bias in the Pentagon's decision after Amazon announced plans to challenge it. DEC. 9, 2019: Amazon accused U.S. President Donald Trump of exerting \"improper pressure\" and bias that led the Department of Defense to award a lucrative $10 billion cloud contract to rival Microsoft. JAN. 22, 2020: Amazon filed a motion in court to pause the Department of Defense and Microsoft from carrying out the deal until a court rules on its protest of the contract award. FEB. 10, 2020: Amazon sought to depose Trump and Esper in its lawsuit over whether the president was trying \"to screw Amazon\" when the Pentagon awarded a contract for cloud computing to rival Microsoft. MARCH 7, 2020: A U.S. judge said Amazon is likely to succeed on a key argument of its challenge to the decision to award the cloud deal to Microsoft. APRIL 15, 2020: The Pentagon's inspector general said it could not determine whether the White House influenced the award of a $10 billion contract to Microsoft over Amazon after several officials said their conversations were privileged \"presidential communications.\" APRIL 17, 2020: A U.S. judge put on hold Amazon's lawsuit. SEPT. 4, 2020: The Defense Department completed a re-evaluation of its $10 billion JEDI cloud computing contract proposals and determined that Microsoft bid was the best. APRIL 28, 2021: A judge refused to dismiss Amazon's claims alleging the Trump administration interfered in the Pentagon's award of its $10 billion JEDI cloud computing contract to Microsoft.

{"title": "Factbox: Six things to know about the Pentagon's defunct JEDI contract", "text": "The Pentagon logo is seen behind the podium in the briefing room at the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, U.S., January 8, 2020. REUTERS/Al Drago/File Photo July 7 (Reuters) - The U.S. Defense Department canceled its $10 billion JEDI cloud-computing project this week, reversing the Trump-era award to Microsoft Corp   and announcing a new contract expected to include its rival Amazon.com Inc   and possibly other cloud players.  Here are six things to know about the now-defunct cloud computing contract. WHAT WAS THE JEDI CONTRACT? The Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) was an IT modernization project to build a large, common commercial cloud for the Department of Defense. Data from many Pentagon programs remains isolated in separate systems that cannot easily share information such as targeting, or logistical data. Moving the Pentagon to the cloud is intended to make war-fighting easier and more seamless. WHY WAS JEDI REPLACED? While the Trump administration wanted a single cloud-computing provider for the Department of Defense as laid out under JEDI, the Biden administration canceled it in favor of parceling out the project to multiple firms. Such a move would put the military more in line with private-sector companies, many of whom split up their cloud computing work among multiple vendors to avoid being locked in to any specific one. WHAT WILL REPLACE THE JEDI CONTRACT? The Pentagon hopes to have the first awards by April 2022 for its new Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability (JWCC), a multi-award, multi-vendor cloud contract for up to five years. Microsoft and Amazon will likely win direct awards. WHAT OTHER COMPANIES COULD BENEFIT FROM THE NEW JWCC   CONTRACT? Other top cloud companies include Oracle Corp  , Alphabet Inc's   Google and IBM Corp  . Google and IBM said they were both interested in working with the federal government but stopped short of saying whether they would bid. The Pentagon welcomed companies other than Microsoft and Amazon, adding they would need to meet unnamed requirements likely focused in part on data security. WHAT ARE THE ISSUES SURROUNDING JEDI, AND MICROSOFT AND AMAZON? Amazon Web Services, the biggest cloud computing provider, was widely expected to win the contract when it was first announced. But when the Pentagon awarded the sole-source deal to Microsoft in 2019, Amazon filed a lawsuit challenging the decision under then-President Donald Trump, alleging the former president exerted improper pressure on military officials to steer the contract away from Amazon. WHAT WAS TRUMP'S ROLE IN THE JEDI CONTRACT AWARD? Amazon said in 2019 the Pentagon decision was full of \"egregious errors,\" which it suggested were a result of \"improper pressure from Trump.\" Trump publicly derided then-Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and repeatedly criticized the company. Amazon in its lawsuit cited a 2019 book that reported Trump had directed the Defense Department to \"screw Amazon\" out of the JEDI contract.

{"title": "Pentagon hits reset on Trump's $10 bln cloud deal, welcoming new players", "text": "WASHINGTON, July 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. Defense Department canceled its $10 billion JEDI cloud-computing project on Tuesday, reversing the Trump-era award to Microsoft Corp   and announcing a new contract expected to include its rival Amazon.com   and possibly other cloud players. The contract was coveted not for its dollar value as much as its prestige: Both companies for years have sought to persuade businesses and governments that it was safe to shift computing work into their data centers. Meeting all the security requirements of the U.S. military would have been a visible stamp of approval likely to sway other corporate and government clients, analysts said. Seattle-based Amazon, the biggest cloud computing provider, was widely expected to win the contract. But when the Pentagon awarded the sole-source deal to Microsoft in 2019, the announcement gave \"huge credibility\" to Microsoft, which had been working hard to catch Amazon after a late start with cloud technology, said Mark Moerdler, a senior research analyst at Bernstein. But the contract   after Amazon filed a lawsuit challenging the decision under then-President Donald Trump, alleging that the former president exerted improper pressure on military officials to steer the contract away from Amazon.  Trump   and repeatedly criticized the company. Amazon said in 2019 the Pentagon decision was full of \"egregious errors,\" which it suggested were a result of \"improper pressure from Trump.\" The company cited a 2019 book that reported Trump had directed the Defense Department to   out of the JEDI contract. Shares of Microsoft and Amazon both closed at a record high with the online retailer up 4.7% and shares of the software firm a penny higher. Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, said the absolute dollars involved - $10 billion over a decade - are at most a nice-to-have for the cloud companies, with AWS alone generating $45.3 billion in sales and $13.5 billion in operating profits for 2020. The value, he said, was in showcasing the security of the clouds, \"but it's not going to move the needle\" for either company. But the cancellation and new contract could benefit Microsoft, Moerdler said, because the Redmond, Washington-based company has had nearly two years during the legal wrangling to invest in its technology. \"If there is now another competition, Microsoft is going in from a better position,\" Moerdler said. As recently as September the Defense Department re-evaluated the contract proposals and said Microsoft's submission was the best.  While the Trump administration wanted a single provider, the Biden administration has said it would likely parcel out the project to multiple companies. Such a move would put the military more in line with private-sector companies, many of whom split up their cloud computing work among multiple vendors to avoid being locked in to any specific one.

Google and IBM on Tuesday said they were both interested in working with the federal government but stopped on short of saying whether they would enter the bidding process. The Pentagon hopes to have the first awards by April 2022 for its new Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability (JWCC). John Sherman, acting chief information officer for the Defense Department, said he expects both Microsoft and Amazon will get cloud contracts. He said the need was urgent. \"I've got to get this now -- as soon as possible -- starting hopefully as soon as April,\" Sherman said. Microsoft said in a statement the company was confident it will \"continue to be successful as the DoD selects partners for new work\". Microsoft could submit a termination bid to recover costs of the scrapped project, Sherman said. Amazon's cloud unit Amazon Web Services (AWS) said it agreed with the Pentagon's decision to cancel the contract. Amazon said the initial award was \"not based on the merits of the proposals and instead was the result of outside influence that has no place in government procurement.\" AWS added it looks \"forward to continuing to support the DoD\u2019s modernization efforts and building solutions that help accomplish their critical missions.\" In April a judge   alleging the Trump administration interfered in the Pentagon's award to Microsoft after putting it on hold indefinitely in February 2020.  The now-cancelled Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud (JEDI) contract was budgeted for as much as $10 billion and was part of a broader digital modernization of the Pentagon aimed at making it more technologically agile. \"We don't have an estimate yet, but I wouldn't latch onto the $10 billion figure,\" Sherman said, but added that the plan would likely involve a direct award for \"urgently needed\" capabilities and then a \"full and open\" competition for multiple suppliers by early 2025. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley praised the Pentagon's decision. \"The JEDI contract has been burdened by potential conflicts of interest, size, needless delays and its single awardee structure,\" Grassley said, saying a fresh review process \"will afford the program an opportunity for greater public trust and confidence.\" Our Standards:  Subscribe for our daily curated newsletter to receive the latest exclusive Reuters coverage delivered to your inbox.

WASHINGTON, July 9 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday dismissed Amazon.com's legal challenge to the Defense Department's2019 decision to award a $10 billion JEDI cloud-computing project to rival Microsoft Corp   after the Pentagon canceled the contract. Amazon.com had accused then-President Donald Trump, alleging that the former president exerted improper pressure on military officials to steer the contract away from Amazon. The Pentagon said on Tuesday it expected the new multi-billion dollar contract would be split between Amazon and Microsoft. Amazon did not object to dismissing its 2019 lawsuit. Judge Patricia E. Campbell-Smith of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims agreed to dismiss the lawsuit at the government's request, saying the case was now moot. Trump publicly derided then-Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and repeatedly criticized the company. Amazon had sought to question Trump about his role in the contract decision. The Pentagon hopes to have the first awards by April 2022 for its new Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability (JWCC). John Sherman, acting chief information officer for the Defense Department, said on Tuesday he expects both Microsoft and Amazon will get cloud contracts. Microsoft said in a statement that the company was confident it will \"continue to be successful as the DoD selects partners for new work.\" Amazon's Amazon Web Services cloud unit said it agreed with the Pentagon's decision to cancel the contract. It said the initial award was \"not based on the merits of the proposals and instead was the result of outside influence that has no place in government procurement.\" In April, Campbell-Smith refused to dismiss Amazon's claims alleging the Trump administration interfered in the Pentagon's award to Microsoft after putting it on hold indefinitely in February 2020. The now-canceled Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud (JEDI) contract was budgeted for as much as $10 billion and was part of a broader digital modernization of the Pentagon aimed at making it more technologically agile.

{"title": "Microsoft to offer cloud-based version of Windows operating system", "text": "A Microsoft logo is seen in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 14, 2016. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson July 14 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp   on Wednesday said it will offer its Windows operating system as a cloud-based service, aiming to make it easier to access business apps that need Windows from a broader range of devices. Windows 365, as the service will be called, will roll out on Aug. 2 and will work somewhat like buying a new Windows PC: A business or school will pick how much computing power, memory and storage they would like for an the new machine. But instead of waiting for a physical machine to arrive in the mail, the employee or student will access the operating system in the cloud via an existing PC, a Mac, iPhone, Android phone or Chromebook, as long as it has a web browser compatible with HTML 5, a widely used internet standard. The cloud-based version was created in response to feedback from clients who wanted employees and students to have quicker and easier PC access regardless of physical location. \"We define that shift to hybrid work as really being flexibility in how, when and where you work. That's really the pattern that we're seeing develop all across the world as people are starting to experiment,\" said Jared Spataro, corporate vice president for Microsoft 365 software. The service is akin to so-called \"virtual\" and \"remote\" desktops that have been around for decades but which require a sophisticated IT department to set up and manage. Those costs can also be unpredictable because they are based on how much the desktops are used. Microsoft hopes the Windows 365 technology will be easy enough for small-business owners or smaller schools to introduce  without a large IT department, with a predictable monthly bill based on the size of each virtual computer. Andrew Hewitt, an analyst at Forrester Research, said the move would help Microsoft defend its dominant market share in the face of strong competition from operating systems from Apple Inc   and Alphabet's Google   that are easier for schools and businesses to manage.

June 15, 2020. REUTERS/Tom Brenner July 17 (Reuters) - Some U.S. tech companies expressed disappointment with a ruling by a federal judge that blocked new applications to a program that protects immigrants who were brought to the United States as children from deportation. U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen on Friday sided with a group of states suing to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, arguing that it was illegally created by former President Barack Obama in 2012.  \"We have long argued in support of this program, filing an amicus brief in this case, and we are very disappointed by the decision (from the judge)\", Google   spokesperson Jose Castaneda said. \"Dreamers and immigrants make the United States \u2014 and Twitter \u2014 better\", a spokesperson from social media platform Twitter   said in an emailed statement. Twitter, Google, Microsoft  and Photoshop maker Adobe   urged the U.S. Congress to come together to protect Dreamers, with Google saying they wanted DACA to be \"cemented\" into law. Microsoft President Brad Smith said that the \"disappointing\" ruling created \"uncertainty yet again for Dreamers.\" The judge ruled on Friday that the program violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) when it was created but said that since there were so many people currently enrolled in the program - nearly 650,000 - his ruling would be temporarily stayed for their cases and their renewal applications. Biden, who was vice president when Obama created the program, has said he wants to create a permanent pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients, known as \"Dreamers.\" On Saturday, Biden vowed to preserve the program that protects from deportation hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, promising to appeal the judge's ruling invalidating it and urging Congress to provide a path to citizenship.

WASHINGTON, June 30 (Reuters) - The United States needs to accord the same legal protections to user data held on tech companies' servers as it does to physical files stored in personal file cabinets, media attorneys and lawmakers said Wednesday. The witnesses spoke at a hearing on whether the U.S. government overuses it secret subpoena power in a way that harms American internet users. The proceeding follows revelations that former President Donald Trump's U.S. Department of Justice secretly sought the phone records of reporters and Democratic representatives to investigate the leaks of classified material.  Word of the DOJ's investigations outraged lawmakers and prompted renewed talk of curbing the federal government's practice of secretly subpoenaing the cloud service providers - companies like Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc  , Apple Inc   and Alphabet Inc's   Google - to win access to their users' emails, documents and instant messages without giving them a chance to defend their interests. U.S. Representative Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat, said the tactic was \"an end run on the protections that the Fourth Amendment is supposed to provide to every American.\" Hearst Corp's chief legal officer, Eve Burton, spoke for many witnesses when she told the House of Representatives' Judiciary Committee that \"the same protections must apply whether the information is sought in an office file or on a cloud server across the country or across the world.\" That call received a warm reception from lawmakers from both sides of the aisle. Representative Tom McClintock, a California Republican, said this kind of surveillance in the United States was \"in direct contravention of its most fundamental law.\" The only representative of the tech industry at the hearing, Microsoft executive Tom Burt, said that in the last five years his company had received 2,400 to 3,500 secrecy orders a year and that U.S. courts provided little by way of meaningful oversight. \"Providers, like Microsoft, regularly receive boilerplate secrecy orders unsupported by any meaningful legal or factual analysis,\" Burt told lawmakers. \"Many of these orders should never have been approved by the courts.\" Burt said that while the effort to target lawmakers and reporters disturbs many Americans, \"what may be most shocking is just how routine court-mandated secrecy has become when law enforcement targets Americans' emails, text messages, and other sensitive data stored in the cloud.\" Subscribe for our daily curated newsletter to receive the latest Reuters legal news and headlines delivered to your inbox.

The company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit said in a redacted Oct. 23 court filing unsealed on Tuesday that the award to Microsoft must \"be invalidated because it is the product of systematic bias, bad faith, and undue influence exerted by President Trump to steer the award away from\" the company. It called it a \"flawed and politically corrupted decision.\" The White House declined to comment, referring questions to the Justice Department. The Pentagon did not immediately comment. Microsoft said in a statement Tuesday \"career procurement officials at the DoD decided that given the superior technical advantages and overall value, we continued to offer the best solution.\" It added \"it is time we moved on and got this technology in the hands of those who urgently need it: the women and men who protect our nation.\" AWS said in a statement Tuesday that as a result of the Pentagon revision in September \"the pricing differential swung substantially, with AWS now the lowest-priced bid by tens of millions of dollars.\" An Amazon logo is pictured at a logistics centre in Mannheim, Germany, September 17, 2019. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski A judge in February granted Amazon's request to temporarily halt the deal from moving forward; that remains in place. The court is considering motions to dismiss Amazon's amended complaint that have been filed by the government and Microsoft. The motions have not been made public and it is not clear when the judge might rule. Amazon, which had been seen as a front-runner to win the contract, filed a lawsuit in November 2019 after the contract was awarded to Microsoft. Trump has publicly derided Amazon head Jeff Bezos and repeatedly criticized the company. Amazon's new filing said Trump and his administration \"intensified a campaign of interference and retribution against those in DoD perceived as disloyal to the president or capable of reaching conclusions at odds with his personal interests.\" The company argued the latest Pentagon review was \"riddled with errors even more egregious than those that plagued the initial award,\" and that the Pentagon \"manipulated its evaluations to a degree that belies any facade of rationality.\"     The Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud (JEDI) contract could reach as much as $10 billion and is part of a broader digital modernization of the Pentagon.

{"title": "SolarWinds hackers accessed Microsoft source code, the company says", "text": "A Microsoft logo is seen in Los Angeles, California U.S. November 7, 2017. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson WASHINGTON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - The hacking group behind the SolarWinds   compromise was able to break into Microsoft Corp   and access some of its source code, Microsoft said on Thursday, something experts said sent a worrying signal about the spies' ambition. Source code - the underlying set of instructions that run a piece of software or operating system - is typically among a technology company's most closely guarded secrets and Microsoft has historically been particularly careful about protecting it.      It is not clear how much or what parts of Microsoft's source code repositories the hackers were able to access, but the disclosure suggests that the hackers who used software company SolarWinds as a springboard to break into sensitive U.S. government networks also had an interest in discovering the inner workings of Microsoft products as well.     Microsoft had already disclosed that like other firms it found malicious versions of SolarWinds' software inside its network, but the source code disclosure - made in a blog post - is new.   After Reuters reported it was breached two weeks ago, Microsoft said it had not \"found any evidence of access to production services.\" Three people briefed on the matter said Microsoft had known for days that the source code had been accessed. A Microsoft spokesman said security employees had been working \"around the clock\" and that \"when there is actionable information to share, they have published and shared it.\" The SolarWinds hack is among the most ambitious cyber operations ever disclosed, compromising at least half-a-dozen federal agencies and potentially thousands of companies and other institutions. U.S. and private sector investigators have spent the holidays combing through logs to try to understand whether their data has been stolen or modified. Modifying source code - which Microsoft said the hackers did not do - could have potentially disastrous consequences given the ubiquity of Microsoft products, which include the Office productivity suite and the Windows operating system. But experts said that even just being able to review the code could offer hackers insight that might help them subvert Microsoft products or services. \"The source code is the architectural blueprint of how the software is built,\" said Andrew Fife of Israel-based Cycode, a source code protection company.  \"If you have the blueprint, it's far easier to engineer attacks.\" Matt Tait, an independent cybersecurity researcher, agreed that the source code could be used as a roadmap to help hack Microsoft products, but he also cautioned that elements of the company's source code were already widely shared - for example with foreign governments. He said he doubted that Microsoft had made the common mistake of leaving cryptographic keys or passwords in the code.   \"It's not going to affect the security of their customers, at least not substantially,\" Tait said. Microsoft noted that it allows broad internal access to its code, and former employees agreed that it is more open than other companies. In its blog post, Microsoft said it had found no evidence of access \"to production services or customer data.\"  \"The investigation, which is ongoing, has also found no indications that our systems were used to attack others,\" it said. Reuters reported a week ago that Microsoft-authorized resellers were hacked and their access to productivity programs inside targets leveraged in attempts to read email. Microsoft acknowledged some vendor access was misused but has not said how many resellers or customers may have been breached. There was no response to requests for comment from the FBI, which is investigating the hacking campaign, or from the Department of Homeland Security's Cybsersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. U.S. officials have attributed the SolarWinds hacking campaign to Russia, an allegation the Kremlin denies.  Both Tait and Ronen Slavin, Cycode's chief technology officer, said a key unanswered question was which source code repositories were accessed. Microsoft has a huge range of products, from widely used Windows to lesser known software such as social networking app Yammer and the design app Sway. Slavin said he was worried by the possibility that the SolarWinds hackers were poring over Microsoft's source code as prelude to a much more ambitious offensive. \"To me the biggest question is, 'Was this recon for the next big operation?'\" he said.

{"title": "Microsoft earnings rise as pandemic boosts cloud computing, Xbox sales", "text": "A Microsoft logo is seen in Los Angeles, California U.S. November 7, 2017. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo Jan 26 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp   on Tuesday reported its Azure cloud computing services grew 50%, the second quarter of acceleration in a business that had begun to slow as the global pandemic benefited the software maker's investment on working and learning from home. The company's shares rose 5% in extended trading after gaining about 41% in 2020 as COVID-19 shifted computing to areas where the software maker has bet big. It also saw a surprise recovery in sales on the LinkedIn professional social network and navigated a chip shortage that had threaten to hold back its Xbox business. The shift to work from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated enterprises' switch to cloud-based computing, benefiting Microsoft and rivals such as Amazon.com Inc's   cloud unit and Alphabet Inc's   Google Cloud.  On a conference call with investors, Microsoft executives said they expect a midpoint of $14.83 billion in revenue from the company's \"Intelligent Cloud\" segment for the fiscal third quarter, compared with Wall Street expectations of $14.12 billion, according to Refinitiv data. For the company's productivity segment and its personal computing segment, sales are expected to have a respective midpoint of $13.48 billion and $12.50 billion, compared with estimates of $12.90 billion and $11.60 billion, according to Refinitiv data.      Microsoft said GamePass, the company's $10 monthly gaming subscription, has 18 million users, up from 15 million disclosed in September. The Xbox Live online gaming service has more than 100 million monthly active users. Microsoft did not give an update on the 115 million Teams daily users it disclosed in October but did say that the mobile version is used by 60 million daily users.  Microsoft said revenue in its \"Intelligent Cloud\" segment rose 23% to $14.6 billion, with 50% growth in Azure. Analysts had expected a 41.4% growth in Azure, according to consensus data from Visible Alpha. The previous quarter Azure grew 48%. \"This was really driven by continued customer demand, with stronger-than-expected consumption as customers have increased their focus on digital transformation,\" Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood told Reuters in an interview.   Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell said that last year, \"economic weakness and delays in implementation had masked the extent to which Azure was benefiting from the accelerated shift to the cloud caused by the pandemic. But with these results that benefit is now plain to see.\" LinkedIn revenue growth, which dipped as the pandemic shut down businesses, reached 23%, near its pre-pandemic rate of 24% a year earlier. Hood said advertisements on LinkedIn drove the increase. \"We continue to see advertising market recovery,\" she said. Microsoft bundles several sets of software and services such as Office and Azure into a \"commercial cloud\" metric that investors watch closely to gauge the company's progress in selling to large businesses.  Commercial cloud gross margins - a measure of the profitability of its sales to large businesses - were 71% in the quarter, compared with 67% a year earlier. Revenue from its personal computing division, which includes Windows software and Xbox gaming consoles, rose 14% to $15.1 billion, driven by strong Xbox content and services growth, beating analysts' estimates of $13.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Microsoft in November released two new Xbox consoles, its most visible non-work and non-school brand, but the hardware proved difficult to find as a global semiconductor shortage contributed to tight stocks as many retailers. Xbox hardware sales were up 86% despite the shortages, and Hood said growth is likely to continue, with older models also contributing to sales.  \"Demand still outpaces supply, and we do expect that to continue,\" Hood said. \"The team did a nice job of getting consoles, both of this newest generation as well as continuing to sell the older generation, which provides a great value for gamers.\" Microsoft's gaming business topped $5 billion in quarterly sales for the first time ever and was propelled by gaming subscriptions and sales as well as new consoles. Microsoft said Xbox content and services revenue grew 40% in the quarter. The software giant's overall revenue rose to $43.08 billion in the second quarter ended Dec. 31, from $36.91 billion a year earlier, beating analysts' estimates of $40.18 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

{"title": "Asian shares step back, Microsoft\u2019s brisk earnings boost tech optimism", "text": "Passersby wearing protective face masks walk past a screen displaying Nikkei share average and world stock indexes outside a brokerage, amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Tokyo, Japan October 5, 2020. Picture taken with slow shutter speed. REUTERS/Issei Kato TOKYO/NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Asian equities slipped on Wednesday as investors looked to the Federal Reserve\u2019s guidance on its monetary policy while futures for U.S. tech shares jumped after strong earnings from Microsoft. European stocks are expected to slip a tad, with EuroStoxx 50 futures down 0.3% and FTSE futures shedding 0.4%. MSCI's gauge of Asian ex-Japan shares   slipped 0.2%, dragged lower by profit-taking in resource shares   as some investors have grown wary of stretched valuations. \"The global economy appears to be losing momentum a bit and there is no clear sign yet that COVID-19 infections are slowing even after vaccinations have started in some places. I expect shares to get stuck in a range for a while,\" said Hisashi Iwama, senior portfolio manager at Asset Management One. But the tech sector remained a bright spot after Microsoft's earnings lifted Nasdaq futures 0.5% while Japan's Nikkei   also rose 0.3%. Microsoft shares rose 3.7% in extended trading after its Azure cloud computing services grew 50%, boosting optimism for other U.S. tech giants, including Apple   and Facebook  , which announce quarterly results later in the day.  \"Microsoft's earnings were superb, even compared with strong market expectations,\" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. \"Those tech firm shares have been in a bit of the doldrums since August but they are likely to lead the market again, given their solid outlook,\" he said. At their peak in August, the combined market capitalisation of the top five biggest U.S. tech companies, which also include Amazon   and Alphabet , reached 24.6% of the U.S. blue chip S&P500 index. It stood at 22.7%, still well above 15% two years ago. S&P500 futures were mostly flat, capped by caution ahead of the Fed's policy meeting as well as profit-taking on cyclical shares after stellar gains this month. The S&P500 is now trading at 22.7 times its expected earnings, near its September peak of 23.1 times, which was its most inflated level since the dotcom bubble in 2000. A surge in shares of video games company Gamestop   driven by retail investors also raised some concerns that a rally propelled by loads of stimulus money from governments and central banks has become extreme.  Still, analysts expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to stick to its dovish tone to help speed the economic recovery when it concludes its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. U.S. stimulus talks are also in focus with U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer saying Democrats will move forward on President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan without Republican support if necessary.  Benchmark 10-year notes were yielding 1.035%, having hit a three-week low of 1.028% on Tuesday on rising speculation Biden may have to scale back and possibly delay his ambitious stimulus plan. The U.S. dollar was little moved as investors awaited the Fed's decision for clues on whether they should buy riskier currencies. The dollar index flirted with this week's low at 90.204, while the euro held firm at $1.2161. Sterling rose to as high as $1.3753, a level last seen in May 2018 while the Japanese yen changed hands at 103.70 per dollar . The Australian dollar slipped 0.1% to $0.7739 , showing muted response to stronger-than-expected local inflation data.  Oil prices were supported by economic optimism, with U.S. crude futures trading up 0.6% at $52.95 per barrel. The International Monetary Fund raised its forecast for global growth in 2021, as widely expected, and many investors expect the global economic recovery from the pandemic-driven downturn to continue.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Feb 10 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp   approached Pinterest Inc   in recent months about a potential deal to acquire the $51 billion social media company, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday, citing people briefed on the matter. The negotiations were currently not active, according to the report. ( ) A general shift to virtual interactions leading to increased engagement on social media platforms benefited Pinterest as well, with its monthly active users jumping 37% to 459 million in the fourth quarter.

Pinterest had previously signaled it wants to remain an independent company, the FT said. The social media company generates revenue by placing advertisements next to the Pins, or posts, uploaded on the site by users.

{"title": "At least 10 hacking groups using Microsoft software flaw -researchers", "text": "Silhouettes of laptop and mobile device users are seen next to a screen projection of Microsoft logo in this picture illustration taken March 28, 2018.  REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo WASHINGTON, March 10 (Reuters) - At least 10 different hacking groups are using recently discovered flaws in Microsoft Corp's   mail server software to break in to targets around the world, cybersecurity company ESET said in a blog post on Wednesday. The breadth of the exploitation adds to the urgency of the warnings being issued by authorities in the United States and Europe about the weaknesses found in Microsoft's Exchange software.  The security holes in the widely used mail and calendaring solution leave the door open to industrial-scale cyber espionage, allowing malicious actors to steal emails virtually at will from vulnerable servers or move elsewhere in the network. Tens of thousands of organizations have already been compromised, Reuters reported last week, and new victims are being made public daily. Earlier on Wednesday, for example, Norway's parliament announced data had been \"extracted\" in a breach linked to the Microsoft flaws. Germany's cybersecurity watchdog agency also said on Wednesday two federal authorities had been affected by the hack, although it declined to identify them.  While Microsoft has issued fixes, the sluggish pace of many customers' updates - which experts attribute in part to the complexity of Exchange's architecture - means the field remains at least partially open to hackers of all stripes. The patches do not remove any back door access that has already been left on the machines.  In addition, some of the back doors left on compromised machines have passwords that are easily guessed, so that newcomers can take them over. Microsoft declined comment on the pace of customers' updates. In previous announcements pertaining to the flaws, the company has emphasized the importance of \"patching all affected systems immediately.\"  Although the hacking has appeared to be focused on cyber espionage, experts are concerned about the prospect of ransom-seeking cybercriminals taking advantage of the flaws because it could lead to widespread disruption. ESET's blog post said there were already signs of cybercriminal exploitation, with one group that specializes in stealing computer resources to mine cryptocurrency breaking in to previously vulnerable Exchange servers to spread its malicious software. ESET named nine other espionage-focused groups it said were taking advantage of the flaws to break in to targeted networks - several of which other researchers have tied to China. Microsoft has blamed the hack on China. The Chinese government denies any role.  Intriguingly, several of the groups appeared to know about the vulnerability before it was announced by Microsoft on March 2.  Ben Read, a director with cybersecurity company FireEye Inc   , said he could not confirm the exact details in the ESET post but said his company had also seen \"multiple likely-China groups\" using the Microsoft flaws in different waves. ESET researcher Matthieu Faou said in an email it was \"very uncommon\" for so many different cyber espionage groups to have access to the same information before it is made public. He speculated that either the information \"somehow leaked\" ahead of the Microsoft announcement or it was found by a third party that supplies vulnerability information to cyber spies. Taiwan-based researchers reported to Microsoft on Jan. 5 that they had found two new flaws which need patching. Those two were among those that began being used by the attackers shortly before or after the friendly report.     They said were investigating whether there had been a theft or leak on their side, since exploitation was discovered in the wild the same week later. So far, the group called Devcore said, they had found no evidence. Top-flight hackers are also commonly targeted by other hackers. Just this week, Microsoft patched one of the flaws used by suspected North Koreans in attempts to steal information from Western researchers. But simultaneous discovery happens fairly often, in part because researchers use the same or similar tools to hunt for serious flaws, and many eyes are looking at the same high-value targets. \"It is very likely that some actor groups may have being using these vulnerabilities and led to the result of the attacks being observed by other information security vendors,\" Devcore member Bowen Hsu told Reuters. But the security industry has been abuzz with other theories, including a hack of Microsoft's systems for tracking bugs, which has happened in the past.

{"title": "Up to 60,000 computer systems exposed in Germany to Microsoft flaw - BSI", "text": "BERLIN, March 10 (Reuters) - As many as 60,000 computer systems in Germany were exposed to a flaw that allows unauthorized users to access systems in Microsoft Corp's   email software, the head of its cybersecurity watchdog said on Wednesday. More than half of the vulnerabilities were addressed following a warning last weekend by the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), but around 25,000 systems still need to be fixed, BSI chief Arne Schoenbohm said. \"The warning has worked. In Germany, many Exchange servers have been secured by downloading patches,\" Schoenbohm said in written comments to Reuters. \"Every vulnerable system is one too many and can lead to harm.\"  The flaw appears to have been widely exploited by hackers and affected more than 20,000 U.S. organisations. The European Union's banking regulator and the Norwegian parliament have also been hit.  In a 14-page report on the Microsoft vulnerability, the BSI said the behaviour of hackers exploiting it had changed sharply since it was publicly revealed. Initially, most targets had been think tanks, universities, non-governmental organisations, law firms and defence companies - mostly in the United States. \"Now, these exploits are being deployed at mass scale against thousands of targets - apparently worldwide,\" the report said. At least 10 different hacking groups were using the latest flaw in Microsoft's mail server software to break into targets around the world, according to researchers at cybersecurity company ESET. In Germany, two federal authorities have been affected by the hack, the BSI said, declining to say which. The BSI said it had been contacted since the weekend by around 100 companies ranging from small businesses to leading companies seeking guidance, well above the usual number. \"We are in touch with all Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERT) in Europa and abroad, especially the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in the United States,\" the BSI said, adding it was also in close contact with Microsoft.

{"title": "Microsoft says ransom-seeking hackers taking advantage of server flaws", "text": "A man holds a laptop computer as cyber code is projected on him in this illustration picture taken on May 13, 2017.  REUTERS/Kacper Pempel/Illustration WASHINGTON, March 11 (Reuters) - Ransom-seeking hackers have begun taking advantage of a recently disclosed flaw in Microsoft\u2019s widely used mail server software, the company said early Thursday - a serious escalation that could portend widespread digital disruption. The disclosure, initially made on Twitter by Microsoft Corp   security program manager Phillip Misner and later confirmed by the Redmond, Washington-based company, is the realization of worries that have been coursing through the security community for days. Since March 2, when Microsoft announced the discovery of serious vulnerabilities in its Exchange software, experts have warned that it was only a matter of time before ransomware gangs began using them to shake down organizations across the internet. Misner didn't immediately respond to follow-up messages and Microsoft did not return emails seeking further comment. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the FBI also didn't immediately respond. Even though the security holes announced by Microsoft have since been fixed, organizations worldwide have failed to patch their software, leaving them open to exploitation. Experts attribute the sluggish pace of many customers\u2019 updates in part to the complexity of Exchange\u2019s architecture and lack of expertise. In Germany alone, officials have said that  .  All manner of hackers have begun taking advantage of the holes - one security firm recently counted   using the flaws - but ransomware operators are among the most feared.  Those groups work by locking users out of their devices and data unless the victims cough up big chunks of digital currency. They now potentially have access \"into a huge number of vulnerable systems,\" said Brett Callow of cybersecurity company Emsisoft. He said more modest companies - many of which lack the ability or awareness to update their software - could be particularly affected by the latest variant of ransomware. \"This is a potentially serious risk to small businesses,\" he said.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo April 12 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp   said on Monday it would buy artificial intelligence and speech technology firm Nuance Communications Inc   for about $16 billion, as it expands cloud solutions for healthcare customers. The deal comes after the companies partnered in 2019 to automate clinical administrative work such as documentation. It shows Microsoft's ambition to extend its leadership into an industry where digital transformation has picked up speed during the pandemic. Healthcare providers have invested more in technology to improve productivity and digital health services. \"This acquisition brings our technology directly into the physician and patient loop, which is central to all healthcare delivery. The acquisition will also expand our leadership in cross-industry enterprise AI and biometric security,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on an investor call. Microsoft's offer of $56 per share represents a premium of 22.86% to Nuance's closing price on Friday. The shares gained 16% to close at $52.85 on Monday. Nuance, known for pioneering speech technology and helping launch Apple Inc's   virtual assistant, Siri, has gone through strategic reviews led by Chief Executive Mark Benjamin. Once offering voice recognition technologies across industries, the company now focuses on healthcare and enterprise AI after spinning off and selling a number of less profitable business units. The company said it serves 77% of U.S. hospitals, providing intelligent solutions including clinical speech recognition, medical transcription and medical imaging. \"Nuance's strong position at the edge (medical dictation and transcription) will ultimately tie healthcare customers more strongly into Microsoft's Azure Cloud and intelligent services,\u201d Forrester analyst J.P. Gownder wrote in a note on Monday. With operations in 28 countries, the Burlington, Massachusetts-based company reported $1.5 billion in revenue in fiscal-year 2020, with two-thirds of it coming from healthcare. Benjamin will remain CEO of Nuance and will report to Scott Guthrie, executive vice president of Cloud & AI at Microsoft, the company said. ( ) The deal follows Microsoft's recent $7.5 billion acquisition of gaming company ZeniMax Media, and reports that Microsoft was in talks to buy messaging platform Discord, which also allows live audio events. Once closed, the deal for Nuance would be Microsoft's second-biggest, after its $26.2 billion acquisition of LinkedIn in 2016. Including net debt, the all-cash transaction is valued at $19.7 billion.

REUTERS/Leah Millis/File Photo WASHINGTON, April 13 (Reuters) - The top cybersecurity official in the White House on Tuesday directed all government agencies to urgently apply new patches for Microsoft   Corp Exchange email servers to head off exploitation by hackers. The rare directive applies to software fixes for four flaws discovered by the U.S. National Security Agency and reported to Microsoft. \"We recognize when vulnerabilities may pose such a systemic risk that they require expedited disclosure,\" Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber & Emerging Technologies Anne Neuberger said in a statement. Microsoft said it had not seen the problems being exploited so far, but hackers will study the new patches to see what they are fixing, then deploy attacks against unpatched machines. The new flaws come on top of those used in a flood of attacks earlier this year that compromised more than 20,000 U.S. on-premises Exchange servers handling web versions of Outlook mail. Though the vast majority of those vulnerable to the previous round of attacks have now patched their systems, Justice Department officials said Tuesday they had won court permission to gain access to privately owned servers and remove the web shells left by some of the hackers for future remote access. That sort of active engagement by U.S. officials is expected to accelerate with this week's nominations of NSA veterans to other national cyber security posts, including a head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency at the Department of Homeland Security.

The latest funding round comes amid a frenzy of interest from global investors in gaining exposure to the fast growing Southeast Asian technology sector with the prospect of listings of startups worth tens of billions of dollars. The funding round for the 11-year old startup, which claims over 100 million users, also included SC Ventures, the investment arm of Standard Chartered [RIC:RIC:STANB.UL], and South Korean web portal Naver Corp  . Bukalapak, which in October 2019 said it was valued at more than $2.5 billion, declined to comment. Sources told Reuters that the company is currently planning to list in Indonesia, where it has hired Bank Mandiri's securities arm Mandiri Sekuritas, before eyeing a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in the United States.

{"title": "Discord ends sale talks with Microsoft - sources", "text": "A Microsoft logo is seen on an office building in New York City, U.S. on July 28, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Segar April 20 (Reuters) - Messaging platform Discord Inc has ended deal talks with Microsoft Inc   and plans to focus on expanding the business as a standalone company, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. The company will focus on building the chat platform and making money from its user base that has grown quickly during the pandemic. A public listing is on the table but not imminent, the sources added. Microsoft and Discord did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Reuters had   in March that Microsoft was in talks to buy Discord for more than $10 billion.  Social networking has grown during the COVID-19 pandemic as people increasingly goonline for activities from gaming to investment. Discord, which allows public and private groups to gather and chat by text, audio and video, has expanded from a gamers club to all types of communities, including sports fans, music groups and cryptocurrency investors. With over 140 million users, its business model stands out in the social network space where so many technology companies, such as Facebook Inc  and Twitter Inc , rely on advertising for the bulk of the revenue. The San Francisco-based company's revenue grew to $130 million last year through its Nitro premium subscriptions, at $9.99 monthly or $99.99 annually, for features such as special emojis and enhanced video resolution. In December, Discord raised $100 million in a private funding round that valued it at $7 billion, counting Greenoaks Capital and Index Ventures as investors. Microsoft has been on an acquisition spree following its failed bid for TikTok last summer. This year, it has acquired gaming company Zenimax in a $7.5 billion acquisition and speech technology firm Nuance Communications Inc   for about $16 billion.

Matthew Knight/Pool via REUTERS WASHINGTON, April 20 (Reuters) - Bill Gates will address a climate summit hosted by President Joe Biden this week and nearly all of the 40 world leaders that were invited have confirmed they will attend, according to a source familiar with matter. Microsoft Corp   co-founder and philanthropist Gates will address the second day of the summit, which kicks off virtually on Thursday and will conclude on Friday.  The White House event paves the way for another global summit in November in the Scottish city of Glasgow that aims to ensure the world meets a goal of limiting planetary warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson are among the leaders of countries that contribute the most to emissions who will speak. Biden has made fighting climate change a top domestic and international priority and this week's summit is a chance for him to convince his counterparts that the United States is back as a leader on the issue after former President Donald Trump pulled out of the Paris Agreement to cut global emissions. Biden brought the United States back into the accord at the beginning of his administration in January and the White House plans to unveil a new commitment to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 shortly. Sources familiar with the matter expect the administration to pledge to cut U.S. emissions around 50% compared with 2005 levels.  On Thursday, major economies will discuss those climate change commitments, according to the source familiar with the plan. Finance, the role of capital markets, adaptation and resilience to climate change will also be discussed. On Friday the president's \"Build Back Better\" program will be in focus. Biden has made clear he sees fighting climate change as an opportunity to create jobs, and his infrastructure bill includes funding that is critical to his administration's plan to reduce greenhouse gases. Innovation in clean energy and \"industries that have yet to be created\" will also be discussed. Gates will address that broad topic with his remarks. The software developer has invested some $2 billion toward the development of clean technologies.

{"title": "Microsoft sales grow on cloud strength, shares dip on heightened valuation", "text": "A Microsoft logo is seen on an office building in New York City, U.S. on July 28, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo April 27 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp   on Tuesday met analysts' quarterly sales expectations and beat profit estimates, but its shares fell slightly reflecting some skepticism about one-off benefits included in the results and high hopes after a year-long rally. By grabbing market share in the booming market for cloud computing and expanding business services such as its Teams collaboration service and LinkedIn social network, the Redmond, Washington company has become one of the world's most valuable companies, worth close to $2 trillion after a 50% stock runup over the past year. Those services were still in demand during the pandemic, with Microsoft's Azure cloud service closing ground on market-share leader Amazon Web Services   and growing 50% in the quarter. People working and studying from home bought new PCs and video consoles, spurring Microsoft Windows operating system and video game businesses. Net income for the third quarter ended March 31 jumped 44% on a year ago to $15.5 billion. Revenue and adjusted earnings per share were $41.7 billion and $1.95 per share, above analysts' estimates of $41.03 billion and $1.78 per share, according to data from Refinitiv. Shares fell 2.5%, paring some deeper losses after  executives gave a better-than-expected forecast during a conference call with investors. \"One-off tax and currency advantages have boosted Microsoft's third-quarter numbers, and as a result the market isn't being quite as welcoming of expectation-beating numbers as you might expect,\" said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. Net profit had included a favorable $620 million tax benefit from court rulings in India. \"That is the danger of trading on the kind of valuation Microsoft enjoys, 32.8 times next year's earnings. Disappoint even a little and the market will be unforgiving.\" Sales for what Microsoft calls its \"commercial cloud\" - which contains server infrastructure such as Azure along with cloud-based versions of its Office software - was up 33% at $17.7 billion. Sales for Dynamics 365 customer management, which competes directly with Salesforce.com  , rose 45% and the business version of Office 365 added 15% more users. \"That's the fourth consecutive quarter of 15% seat growth on a very large base,\" Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said of the Office 365 results for commercial customers. Microsoft has continued to double down on cloud-base software and said earlier this month it would buy artificial intelligence software firm Nuance Communications Inc   for $16 billion, excluding net debt, to bolster its healthcare business.  Microsoft said Azure, its closely watched cloud computing business that competes with Amazon.com Inc's   Amazon Web Services and Alphabet Inc's   Google Cloud, grew 50% in the quarter, or 46% when adjusted for currency variations. This is down from a currency-adjusted 48% the quarter before but in line with analysts' expectations of 46.3% growth, according to data from Visible Alpha. Overall sales at Microsoft's \"intelligent cloud\" unit that contains Azure were $15.1 billion, above analysts' estimates of $14.92 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Microsoft Teams has 145 million daily users, up from 115 million in October, Microsoft said. Sales for Microsoft's productivity software unit, which includes Office and Teams, were $13.6 billion, compared with estimates of $13.49 billion, according to Refinitiv. Sales for its LinkedIn social network were up 23% on a currency adjusted basis, slightly above Visible Alpha estimates of 21.9%, as revenue continued to recover from a sharp decline in job listings and hiring at the onset of the pandemic. Microsoft's personal computing unit, which contains its Windows operating system and Xbox gaming console, had $13.0 billion in sales, compared with analysts' expectations of $12.57 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Sales of Windows to PC makers were up 10%, compared to a 1% rise the quarter earlier. On a call with investors, Microsoft forecast fiscal fourth-quarter productivity segment revenue with a midpoint of $13.93 billion, above Refinitiv estimates of $13.57 billion. Its sales forecasts for its intelligent cloud and personal computing businesses had midpoints of $16.32 billion and $13.80 billion, respectively, above estimates of $16.0 billion and $13.26 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton April 28 (Reuters) - The Dow and Nasdaq indexes fell on Wednesday as Amgen and Microsoft weighed, while investors focused on a Federal Reserve meeting for updates on monetary policy and waited for another batch of earnings from big technology firms. The U.S. central bank's policy statement is expected to largely follow the mold established in December, when the Fed said it would not change monetary policy until there was \"substantial further progress\" in meeting its maximum employment and 2% inflation goals. The statement is due at 2 p.m. EDT.  \"Investors are obviously looking for a continuation of the policy, which is very accommodative,\" said Andre Bakhos,  managing director at New Vines Capital LLC, New Jersey. \"They don't want to hear, 'We are going to raise rates'. If something goes wrong, investors want to know the Fed will be there.\" The S&P 500 touched an all-time high earlier in the session, powered by shares of Google parent Alphabet Inc  , which jumped 3.7% after reporting a record profit for the second consecutive quarter and announcing a $50 billion share buyback.  Both Alphabet and the S&P 500 communication services sector  , which houses the company, also hit record highs. Market participants are now prepping for results of Apple Inc   and Facebook Inc   after markets close. Facebook Inc   is expected to report a rise in first-quarter revenue, while Apple Inc   is expected to post a more than 32% jump in second-quarter revenue. Shares of Facebook rose 1.4%, while Apple dipped 0.2%. At 12:08 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average   was down 117.71 points, or 0.35%, at 33,867.22, the S&P 500   was up 1.79 points, or 0.04%, at 4,188.51 and the Nasdaq Composite   was down 32.39 points, or 0.23%, at 14,057.83. The tech-heavy Nasdaq   on Monday completed a full recovery from its 11% correction that began in February, largely supported by a rise in mega-cap stocks and ebbing inflation fears. Microsoft Corp   met quarterly sales expectations and beat profit estimates, but its shares fell 3.3% and pressured the Nasdaq due to skepticism about one-off benefits included in the results and high hopes after a year-long rally.  Biotech Amgen Inc's   7.5% decline weighed on the Dow    after it said its first-quarter sales and profit fell due to a 7% drop in its net drug prices and a hit from the COVID-19 pandemic.  Boeing Co   fell 3.4% after posting a wider-than-expected quarterly loss and pausing 737 MAX deliveries over an electrical issue that has partly re-grounded the fleet.  Overall earnings for S&P 500 companies in the first quarter are expected to jump 39.2% from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv IBES data. U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to unveil a sweeping $1.8 trillion package for families and education in his first joint speech to Congress, senior White House officials say.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.24-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.06-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid     April 27 (Reuters) - Tepid results from Tesla and 3M weighed on Wall Street on Tuesday as investors focused on an approaching wave of earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and other corporate heavyweights. Electric-car maker Tesla Inc   dropped 3% after its quarterly results late on Monday fell short of some investors' expectations, with its revenue beat largely supported by sales of environmental credits and selling bitcoin, rather than vehicle sales.  Microsoft Corp   and Alphabet Inc   slipped ahead of their quarterly reports after the bell. Shares of Apple Inc  , Facebook Inc   and Amazon.com Inc  , slated to report later this week, were mixed. Shares of 3M Co   fell 2.7% after the conglomerate said supply chain disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic and the February winter storm were pushing up its costs.  First-quarter overall earnings per share for S&P 500 companies are expected to jump 35% from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv IBES data. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq ended at record levels on Monday, and have mainly been supported by ebbing inflation worries, improving economic data, swift vaccine distribution and unprecedented monetary and fiscal measures. \"We are in that spot where the economy is recovering, there is stimulus money to be spent and people have increased their desire and propensity to consume. For the remainder of the year, you're going to see some fairly optimistic thoughts,\" said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta. Investors will monitor the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting for cues on the central bank's thinking on inflation, bond buying and risks to the financial system posed by soaring asset prices. The Fed is not expected to change its policy guidance at the end of the meeting on Wednesday.  In the latest upbeat economic data, U.S. consumer confidence jumped to a 14-month high in April as more services businesses reopened on increased vaccinations and additional fiscal stimulus.  In afternoon trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average   was down 0.01% at 33,979.71 points, while the S&P 500   lost 0.02% to 4,186.61. The Nasdaq Composite   dropped -0.31% to 14,094.32. Also expected to report after the bell on Tuesday were companies including Visa  , Texas Instruments  , Amgen   and Starbucks  . United Parcel Service Inc   jumped 11% after it topped estimates for quarterly revenue.  General Electric  fell 2.2% after it disappointed investors who were expecting the industrial conglomerate to upgrade its 2021 outlook.  Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.06-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.39-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol/File Photo WASHINGTON, April 28 (Reuters) - A U.S. Court of Federal Claims judge on Wednesday refused to dismiss Amazon.com's  claims alleging the Trump administration interfered in the Pentagon's award of its $10 billion JEDI cloud computing contract to Microsoft Corp  \n                . Judge Patricia E. Campbell-Smith disclosed her decision to reject motions to dismiss part of Amazon's 2019 lawsuit by Microsoft and the U.S. Department of Justice, filed when Donald Trump was still president, but did not immediately make public her opinion. Amazon Web Services responded in a statement: \"The record of improper influence by former President Trump is disturbing, and we are pleased the court will review the remarkable impact it had on the JEDI contract award.\" While president, Trump publicly derided Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and repeatedly criticized the company. Amazon had been seen as a front-runner to win the contract. In September, the U.S. Defense Department completed a comprehensive re-evaluation and said it determined that Microsoft still represented the best value for the government. Microsoft said in a statement the ruling \"changes little. Not once, but twice, professional procurement staff at the (Defense Department) chose Microsoft after a thorough review.\" The company added it has \"continued for more than a year to do the internal work necessary to move forward on JEDI quickly.\" The contract remains on hold after Judge Campbell-Smith   granted Amazon's request in February 2020 to temporarily halt the deal from moving forward. The Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud (JEDI) contract could reach as much as $10 billion and is part of a broader digital modernization of the Pentagon aimed at making it more technologically agile. Amazon filed its lawsuit in November 2019, weeks after the contract was awarded to Microsoft. It said the Pentagon decision was full of \"egregious errors\", which it suggested were a result of \"improper pressure from Trump.\" Our Standards:  Subscribe for our daily curated newsletter to receive the latest exclusive Reuters coverage delivered to your inbox.

{"title": "Melinda Gates sees U.S. government donating COVID vaccine doses soon", "text": "Melinda Gates, co-founder of Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, speaks during an United Nations' Every Woman, Every Child news conference in New York September 24, 2015. REUTERS/Pearl Gabel LONDON, May 4 (Reuters) - Melinda Gates, co-founder of one of the world's largest private charitable foundations, expects the U.S. government will soon weigh up how much of its vaccine supply to donate bilaterally and through the global COVAX programme. In her first remarks to be broadcast since she and her husband, Microsoft Corp   co-founder Bill Gates, announced they would divorce after 27 years, Gates said governments were waking up to arguments that the global economy needs to be vaccinated to bring the pandemic under control. \"I think the U.S. government is looking at their supply of vaccine and deciding, okay how much should we do through COVAX, how much should we do bilaterally, so I think you're going to start to see some movement there,\" Gates said in an interview with the Financial Times recorded before the divorce announcement. Wealthy nations did not need to vaccinate down to their teen populations before they started sharing doses with low-income countries, Gates said, and suggested governments should pick an age range, somewhere between 20 and 30, when they would start donating vaccines. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has become one of the most powerful and influential forces in global public health, and last year committed about $1.75 billion to COVID-19 relief. The 56-year-old Texas-raised computer scientist, who met Bill Gates, 65, at a company dinner in New York, will continue to run the foundation with him. Gates was cool on the idea of waiving intellectual property rights to help increase vaccine supply, saying it made more sense to incentivise pharmaceutical companies to carry out technology transfers. \"The piece that is not working today is the manufacturing,\" she said. \"We don't have enough raw materials, we don't have enough manufacturing in the right places, so it is allowing the nations that have manufacturing in place to hoard their vaccines, so we got to fix that piece.\" Our Standards:  Subscribe for our daily curated newsletter to receive the latest exclusive Reuters coverage delivered to your inbox.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid May 10 (Reuters) - U.S. Pentagon officials are mulling ending its JEDI cloud-computing project, caught up in litigation from Amazon.com Inc  , the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. ( ) Amazon, which was seen as a front-runner to win the $10 billion JEDI project that went to Microsoft Corp   in 2019, has argued the contract process reflected undue influence from former President Donald Trump. A U.S. Court of Federal Claims judge last month refused to dismiss Amazon's claims alleging the Trump administration interfered in the Pentagon's award.  Last year, the U.S. Defense Department completed a comprehensive re-evaluation of its contract proposals and determined that Microsoft's submission still represented the best value for the government.  Microsoft said in an emailed statement on Monday it was ready to deliver on JEDI, but that the litigation battle was harmful. \"We agree with the US Departments of Defense and Justice that prolonged litigation is harmful and has delayed getting this technology to our military service members who need it,\" Microsoft said. Amazon's cloud unit reiterated its previous stance, claiming the JEDI contract award to Microsoft was affected by \"improper influence\" from former President Trump.

{"title": "France embraces Google, Microsoft in quest to safeguard sensitive data", "text": "A sign is pictured outside a Google office near the company's headquarters in Mountain View, California, U.S., May 8, 2019.  REUTERS/Paresh Dave/ PARIS, May 17 (Reuters) - Some of France's most sensitive state and corporate data can be safely stored using the cloud computing technology developed by Alphabet's Google   and Microsoft  , if it is licensed to French companies, the government said on Monday. The comment, part of strategic plan laid out by French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire and two other ministers, acknowledges U.S. technological superiority in the field and contrasts with previous calls from European politicians for fully homegrown alternatives. Google and Microsoft, along with market leader Amazon, dominate the realm of data storage worldwide, fuelling concerns in Europe over the risk of surveillance by the United States in the wake of the adoption of the U.S. CLOUD Act of 2018. Yet a \"trustworthy\" cloud computing alternative can be developed within Europe, Le Maire said, by guaranteeing the location of servers on French soil as well as European ownership of the companies that store and process the data. \"We therefore decided that the best companies - I'm thinking in particular of Microsoft or Google - could license all or part of their technology to French companies,\" Le Maire said at a news conference. He did not mention Amazon. Google said it welcomed the \"clarification\" provided by the French government, adding that it supported \"the need for the greatest security levels\". Microsoft said this was good news for France's digital transformation \"in complete independence\". Amazon's cloud unit has been collaborating via partnerships with several major French companies, including state-controlled telecoms firm Orange  , its general manager in France Julien Groues told Reuters. \"This is something that we've been doing for many years,\" he said. Le Maire compared the licences he mentioned with the ones seen in the 1960s in the field of the civil nuclear energy between France and the United States. A so-called \"trustworthy cloud\" label would be delivered to the companies that offer cloud computing services that respect the principles spoken of by Le Maire, and other conditions set by France's cybersecurity agency ANSSI. OVHcloud and Dassault Systemes' Outscale are two French companies that already fulfil these criteria. OVHcloud said late last year it had partnered with Google to build its cloud computing capacities.  \"We... hope that other Franco-American alliances will emerge in this area, which will allow us to have the best technology while guaranteeing the independence of French data,\" said Minister for Digital Affairs Cedric O.

{"title": "Microsoft says it investigated Gates' involvement with employee", "text": "May 17 (Reuters) - Microsoft   conducted a probe into co-founder Bill Gates' involvement with an employee almost 20 years ago after it was told in 2019 that he had tried to start a romantic relationship with the person, the company said on Monday. Microsoft said it had received a concern in the latter half of 2019 that Gates \"had sought to initiate an intimate relationship with a company employee in the year 2000,\" a Microsoft spokesman said in a statement. \"A committee of the Board reviewed the concern, aided by an outside law firm to conduct a thorough investigation. Throughout the investigation, Microsoft provided extensive support to the employee who raised the concern,\" the statement said. The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that Microsoft's board had decided that Gates' involvement with the female employee was inappropriate and he needed to step down in 2020, citing people familiar with the matter. The Microsoft spokesman declined to comment on whether the board had decided Gates should go. Bill Gates, Co-Chair of Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation arrives at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France, April 16, 2018. REUTERS/Charles Platiau In a statement to the Wall Street Journal, a spokesman for Gates said his decision to leave the board of Microsoft had nothing to do with his involvement with an employee. \"There was an affair almost 20 years ago which ended amicably. Bill's decision to transition off the board was in no way related to this matter,\" the statement said. \"In fact, he had expressed an interest in spending more time on his philanthropy starting several years earlier.\" A spokesman for the Gates Foundation told Reuters it stood by the statement to the paper. The billionaire, who co-founded Microsoft in 1975 and served as its CEO until 2000, said in March 2020 that he was stepping down from the board to focus more on philanthropy.

{"title": "Soccer La Liga teams up with Microsoft to lift revenues as TV rights market cools", "text": "Soccer Football - La Liga Santander - Celta Vigo v Real Madrid - Balaidos, Vigo, Spain - August 17, 2019  General view of ball  REUTERS/Miguel Vidal MADRID, May 19 (Reuters) - Spain\u2019s La Liga is expanding its partnership with Microsoft   as it looks to boost revenue for its pandemic-hit soccer clubs and re-energise a fanbase that is consuming ever more digital products. The Spanish league, which announced its closer ties with Microsoft on Wednesday, sees the fast-growing world of sports technology as a way of offsetting a cooling television rights market and helping clubs develop on and off the pitch. \"We want to launch a new company... to generate revenue so we are able to redistribute and have better clubs, better stadiums and better players,\" Oscar Mayo, La Liga's head of business and international development, told Reuters. Mayo said LaLiga Tech, as the business is styled, was valued at over 450 million euros ($550 million), noting it would generate a significant chunk of the league's overall revenue in the future. \"Media rights aren't going to grow as they used to in the next 10 years,\" Mayo added. Microsoft executive vice president Jean-Philippe Courtois said his company hoped to help the sports industry digitalise. \"Because of the pandemic most consumers have turned to more digital content,\" Courtois said. \"Leagues cannot be dependent on TV and digital rights... It's not easy to sustain.\" SEEKING CASH La Liga and Microsoft's enhanced partnership will focus on three main areas -- fans, rights holders and commercial partners, plus venue managers, with a view to selling on some  of the technology to other leagues. It is developing personalised OTT (over the top) streaming options to allow fans to choose the camera angle they wish to watch games from, as well as offering augmented reality, virtual reality and 3-D replays. It is also targeting venue managers, helping stadiums install 5G telecoms, deploy COVID-19 safety measures. One key way of capitalising on new technology is through products such as Mediacoach, a statistics platform used by Spanish clubs which is being exported to other leagues. Although La Liga last week agreed an eight-year deal with US broadcaster ESPN worth around $1.2 billion, the overall picture in European soccer is gloomy, with stadiums shut for over a year due to the pandemic and fans switching to at-home streaming services.  A thirst for new revenue spurred last month's doomed attempt - led by Real Madrid and backed by Barcelona - to launch a European Super League. La Liga has vehemently opposed the Super League, with president Javier Tebas saying it would destroy domestic leagues and the very clubs proposing it. Tebas sees technology as a major growth area. \"We are moving into a new era in which technology will become the center of the fan experience and data insights will power the next stage of global growth,\" he said in La Liga's statement.

REUTERS/Mike Segar BOSTON, May 21 (Reuters) - A responsible-investment arm of Canada\u2019s Bank of Montreal   sold roughly $275 million worth of Microsoft Corp   shares because of the company's recent U.S. Army contract for augmented reality headsets, a bank spokesman said on Friday. BMO's responsible investment managers worried that the $22 billion Army contract Microsoft won in March moves the technology from a proof-of-concept phase to a battlefield-ready product outside its investment strategies' mandate, BMO representatives said. The contract \"sits at odds with our central investment philosophy to avoid companies with damaging businesses practices, and we class bespoke military equipment as one component of our avoid criteria,\" Jamie Jenkins, head of the Responsible Global Equities team at BMO, said in an e-mailed statement. Microsoft representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Many traditional socially focused investment funds bar ownership of defense contractors or companies involved in areas like alcohol or gambling. BMO's move shows how such prohibitions can extend to technology companies doing business with government agencies. On Tuesday, Amazon.com Inc   indefinitely extended a moratorium it imposed last year on police use of its facial recognition software due to civil rights concerns. Over the past two years, Microsoft has worked with the Army on the prototyping phase of what is called the Integrated Visual Augmentation System, or IVAS. The project is based on Microsoft's HoloLens product and backed by the Azure cloud computing services. In March the company said the Army had moved into the production phase of the project. BMO will continue to own Microsoft in traditional investment strategies not bound to social-investing strategies, a spokesman said. A deal by BMO to sell its European asset-management business to Ameriprise Financial Inc   for $1.1 billion remains on track to close in the fourth quarter, the BMO spokesman said.

The joint project with Microsoft will beef up the company's capacity to make its production processes more efficient and promote \"sustainability\" within its operations, Codelco said in a statement. Codelco, like many Chilean miners, has fought in recent years to adopt new technologies to boost efficiency and keep down costs at its aging deposits, many of which suffer from declining ore grades. \"We are promoting profound changes so that different areas operate in a completely remote and automated way, reducing risks, improving productivity, safety and reliability of our operation,\" said company executive Alvaro Garcia. Mining companies worldwide are pushing forward with plans to operate mines remotely, reducing the risk of accidents and boosting efficiency. The move towards automation however has led to confrontations with unions, who see it as a threat to their livelihoods. The company said the project with Microsoft will include a training component for the company's workers. The state-run miner has recently ramped up its use of technology to ensure its copper is 100% traceable, a vital step in reducing its carbon footprint and boosting sustainability within its operations.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo BRUSSELS, May 27 (Reuters) - The European Commission and European Parliament's use of cloud computing services provided by Amazon   and Microsoft   has prompted two EU privacy investigations over concerns about the transfer of personal data to the United States. Data privacy came under scrutiny after revelations in 2013 by former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden of mass U.S. surveillance. In response, Europe's highest court last year rejected a transatlantic data transfer deal, known as the Privacy Shield, following a long-running dispute between Facebook   and Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems. EU privacy watchdog the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) on Thursday opened the investigations after identifying certain types of contracts between EU institutions and the two companies that require particular attention. The investigations, one of which focuses on the use of Microsoft Office 365 by the European Commission, will look into whether the EU bodies comply with privacy rules and the Court judgment. The EU watchdog said EU bodies were relying increasingly on cloud-based software and cloud infrastructure or platform services from large U.S. providers governed by legislation that allows disproportionate surveillance activities by the U.S. authorities. \"I am aware that the 'Cloud II contracts' were signed in early 2020 before the Schrems II Judgement and that both Amazon and Microsoft Web Services have announced new measures with the aim to align themselves with the judgment,\" EDPS head Wojciech Wiewiorowski said in a statement. \"Nevertheless, these announced measures may not be sufficient to ensure full compliance with EU data protection law and hence the need to investigate this properly,\" he said. Market leader Amazon, Alphabet   unit Google and Microsoft dominate the realm of data storage worldwide. Microsoft said it was confident that it would be able to swiftly address any concerns. \"We've committed to challenge every government request for an EU public sector or commercial customer's data where we have a lawful basis for doing so,\" a spokeswoman said. \"And we will provide monetary compensation to our customers' users if we disclose data in violation of the applicable privacy laws that causes harm,\" she said.

REUTERS/Lam Yik June 4 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp   on Friday blamed \u201caccidental human error\u201d for its Bing search engine not showing image results for the query \u201ctank man\u201d in the United States and elsewhere after users raised concerns about possible censorship around the Tiananmen Square crackdown anniversary. Users, including in the United Kingdom, Germany and Singapore, reported Friday that when they performed the search Bing returned the message, \"There are no results for tank man.\" David Greene, civil liberties director at the nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation, said that content moderation was impossible to do perfectly and \"egregious mistakes are made all the time.\" But he said it could be more sinister: \"At worst, this was purposeful suppression at the request of a powerful state.\" Hours after Microsoft acknowledged the issue, the \"tank man\" search returned only pictures of tanks elsewhere in the world. \"Tank man\" is often used to describe an unidentified person famously pictured standing before tanks in China's Tiananmen Square during pro-democracy demonstrations in June 1989. Microsoft said the issue was \"due to an accidental human error and we are actively working to resolve this.\" Smaller search engines such as DuckDuckGo that license results from Microsoft faced similar issues around \"tank man\" searches and said they expected a fix soon. Rival Google   showed many results for the famous image when the \"tank man\" search was performed on Friday. A significant percentage of the Microsoft employees who work on Bing are based in China, including some who work on image-recognition software, according to a former employee. China is known to require search engines operating in its jurisdiction to censor results, but those restrictions are rarely applied elsewhere.

{"title": "Microsoft says new breach discovered in probe of suspected SolarWinds hackers", "text": "A Microsoft logo is seen in Los Angeles, California U.S. November 7, 2017. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo SAN FRANCISCO, June 25 (Reuters) - Microsoft   said on Friday an attacker had won access to one of its customer-service agents and then used information from that to launch hacking attempts against customers. The company said it had found the compromise during its response to hacks by a team it identifies as responsible for earlier major breaches at SolarWinds   and Microsoft. Microsoft said it had warned the affected customers. A copy of one warning seen by Reuters said the attacker belonged to the group Microsoft calls Nobelium and that it had access during the second half of May. \"A sophisticated Nation-State associated actor that Microsoft identifies as NOBELLIUM accessed Microsoft customer support tools to review information regarding your Microsoft Services subscriptions,\" the warning reads in part. The U.S. government has publicly attributed the earlier attacks to the Russian government, which denies involvement. When Reuters asked about that warning, Microsoft announced the breach publicly. After commenting on a broader phishing campaign it said had compromised a small number of entities, Microsoft said it had also found the breach of its own agent, who it said had limited powers. The agent could see billing contact information and what services the customers pay for, among other things. \"The actor used this information in some cases to launch highly-targeted attacks as part of their broader campaign,\" Microsoft said. Microsoft warned affected customers to be careful about communications to their billing contacts and consider changing those usernames and email addresses, as well as barring old usernames from logging in. Microsoft said it was aware of three entities that had been compromised in the phishing campaign. It did not immediately clarify whether any had been among those whose data was viewed through the support agent, or if the agent had been tricked by the broader campaign. Microsoft did not say whether the agent was at a contractor or a direct employee. A spokesman said the latest breach by the threat actor was not part of Nobelium's previous successful attack on Microsoft, in which it obtained some source code. In the SolarWinds attack, the group altered code at that company to access SolarWinds customers, including nine U.S. federal agencies. At the SolarWinds customers and others, the attackers also took advantage of weaknesses in the way Microsoft programs were configured, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Microsoft later said the group had compromised its own employee accounts and taken software instructions governing how Microsoft verifies user identities. A White House official said the latest intrusion and phishing campaign was far less serious than the SolarWinds fiasco. \"This appears to be largely unsuccessful, run-of-the-mill espionage,\" the official said. Scott McConnell, a spokesman for Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said the defensive group \u201cis working with Microsoft and our interagency partners to evaluate the impact. We stand ready to assist any affected entities.\u201d A SolarWinds spokesperson said, \"The latest cyberattack reported by Microsoft does not involve our company or our customers in any way.\" Our Standards:  Subscribe for our daily curated newsletter to receive the latest exclusive Reuters coverage delivered to your inbox.

{"title": "Microsoft challenges Apple's business model with new Windows 11 operating system", "text": "A Microsoft logo on a store in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, January  25, 2021. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri June 24 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp   on Thursday showed Windows 11, its first major operating system revamp since 2015 with new changes that take direct aim at Apple Inc's   lucrative App Store business model. Windows 11, which will hit the market by the end of this year, will include a new Windows Store that will let software developers use their own in-app payment systems and pay no commissions to Microsoft. It will also let users both find and run Android mobile applications on their laptops and PCs, thanks to technology assistance from both Amazon.com   and Intel Corp  . The moves stand in contrast to Apple's \"walled garden\" approach, in which the iPhone maker only lets users download software from the App Store and imposes controls on software developers, including a requirement to use Apple's in-app payment systems and pay commissions of up to 30%. The changes amount to a clash of visions between Microsoft, whose market capitalization recently topped $2 trillion, and Apple, the only other U.S.-listed company to hit a $2 trillion valuation. It also challenges Alphabet Inc's   Google Play Store, which also charges developers commissions. \"Windows has always stood for sovereignty for creators and agency for consumers,\" Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive officer, said during an event announcing the new operating system. The software that turned Microsoft into a household name and dominated personal computers for years has been overtaken in popularity by devices using Apple and Google software, but it is still core to Microsoft's strength in the corporate market. Windows 11 will include many features aimed at these users, such as the ability to more seamlessly undock a computer connected to an external monitor to take a call in a quieter room and then return to the docking station afterward. The company also said it will integrate its Teams chat software directly into the operating system, a move that could cause conflict with Slack Technologies Inc  , Microsoft's top rival in the workplace chat sector. Slack, which is being purchased by Salesforce.com Inc   for $27.7 billion, has filed an antitrust complaint against Microsoft in the European Union. Microsoft's upgraded operating system may also appeal to individuals, with new features for gamers such as an Xbox app and better gaming performance. But the biggest shift appears to be to Microsoft's pitch to developers, content creators and others seeking to make money from the world's 1.3 billion Windows users, which is nearly as many as Apple's total installed device base of 1.65 billion users but less than half of Alphabet's 3 billion Android users. Microsoft said on Thursday that it will include new tools for tipping content creators - including local news outlets - directly in the Windows 11 operating system. The company recently cut commissions on games sold through the store to 12%, lower than the 15% it takes on regular apps, and has been a vocal critic of Apple's App Store. Windows powered Microsoft's rise in the 1990s as PCs became a fixture among businesses and consumers. But the operating system took a back seat to Apple's iOS and Alphabet's Google as mobile phones displaced PCs as the primary computing device for billions of users. Windows remains one of the biggest platforms in the technology world, with Microsoft's personal computing segment, which includes Windows revenue from businesses and consumers, accounting for $48.2 billion of its $143 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. Among PCs and laptops, Windows lost some market share in 2020 to Google's Chromebooks as schools opted for cheaper devices for online learning but still retained greater than 80% market share, according to data firm IDC.

REUTERS/Tingshu Wang/File Photo WASHINGTON, July 19 (Reuters) - Four Chinese nationals have been charged in a global hacking campaign aimed at dozens of companies, universities and government agencies in the United States and abroad, the U.S. Justice Department said on Monday. The charges were announced as the United States and a coalition of allies on Monday accused China's Ministry of State Security of a global cyber hacking campaign, specifically attributing a large Microsoft attack disclosed earlier this year to hackers working on Beijing's behalf.  The hacking was sponsored by the Ministry of State Security and focused on information that would significantly benefit Chinese companies and businesses, including research and development processes, according to the indictment cited by the Justice Department. Reaction from the defendants was not immediately available. The defendants and officials in the Hainan State Security Department (HSSS) tried to hide the Chinese government's role in the information theft by using a front company, according to the indictment, which was returned in May and unsealed Friday. The campaign targeted trade secrets in industries including aviation, defense, education, government, health care, biopharmaceutical and maritime industries, according to a Justice Department statement. Victims were in Austria, Cambodia, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Malaysia, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. \"These criminal charges once again highlight that China continues to use cyber-enabled attacks to steal what other countries make, in flagrant disregard of its bilateral and multilateral commitments,\" Deputy U.S. Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in the statement. It said the two-count indictment alleges that Ding Xiaoyang, Cheng Qingmin and Zhu Yunmin were HSSD officers responsible for coordinating computer hackers and linguists at the front companies. The fourth defendant, Wu Shurong, an employee at front company Hainan Xiandun Technology Development Co. Ltd., \"created malware, hacked into computer systems operated by foreign governments, companies and universities, and supervised other Hainan Xiandun hackers,\" the Justice Department said.

{"title": "After $27.7 bln deal, Salesforce aims to connect companies via Slack", "text": "Smartphone with Slack logo stands in a shopping cart on a keyboard in front of displayed Salesforce logo in this picture illustration taken December 1, 2020. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo July 21 (Reuters) - Business software maker Salesforce.com   on Wednesday closed its $27.7 billion purchase of Slack Technologies Inc  , a massive bet that Slack's workplace app will become popular for collaborations within and between companies. U.S. antitrust regulators cleared the deal this week, allowing the creation of a stronger challenger to Microsoft Corp  , the top workplace software provider whose Teams app competes with Slack for market dominance. The merger partners hope the deal will bolster efforts to connect their joint customers to smooth out common business deals, Salesforce President Bret Taylor and Slack Chief Executive Stewart Butterfield said in an interview on Wednesday. They also want to reduce the complexity of using hundreds of different cloud-based apps that have crept into workplaces, they added. For example, a Slack \"channel\" can be created to replace all the emails, phone calls and video conferences that might otherwise occur between a sales team doing a deal with a procurement team at another company. Thousands of apps work with Slack, so documents from third-party platforms like Google Drive can be signed in the channel with services like DocuSign Inc  , Taylor said. \"We did the due diligence for the Slack acquisition in Slack,\" Taylor noted. \"I joked it had the highest billable hours of any channel ever, because we had all the lawyers in there and the investment banks,\" he said, but \"it was really a transformative experience.\" While analysts view Teams as Slack's largest rival, Butterfield said Slack will continue to integrate with the Microsoft app in line with its goal to make it easier for employees to get things done. \"What customers want is interoperability. They don't want to have to make hard choices,\" Butterfield said. \"We'll integrate with everyone - Microsoft and Salesforce, of course, but also ServiceNow and Workday, and more or less anyone you can think of.\" Our Standards:  Subscribe for our daily curated newsletter to receive the latest exclusive Reuters coverage delivered to your inbox.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Aug 4 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge said Microsoft Corp's   LinkedIn must face a lawsuit claiming it inflated the number of people who watched video ads on the networking platform, allowing it to overcharge hundreds of thousands of advertisers. U.S. Magistrate Judge Susan van Keulen, however, on Tuesday dismissed fraud-based claims and an unfair competition claim, saying the plaintiff advertisers did not show that LinkedIn made specific misrepresentations or that its conduct hurt the public at large. But the San Jose, California-based judge let the advertisers pursue claims based on the theory that bot traffic, errant clicks and fraudulent clicks inflated the metrics they relied on when buying LinkedIn ads. Led by TopDevz Inc and Noirefy Inc,the advertisers said LinkedIn had been counting video ad \"views\" from users' LinkedIn apps, even when the videos were playing only off-screen because users had scrolled past them. LinkedIn said in an email on Wednesday it looked forward to showing the claims lacked merit and said it was \"committed to the transparency and integrity of our ads products.\" Warren Postman, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an email he was pleased with the decision and looked forward to proving that LinkedIn broke the law. Van Keulen said the plaintiffs could try to pursue their dismissed claims again. The advertisers sued after   said on Nov. 12 that its engineers had three months earlier found and then fixed software bugs that may have led to more than 418,000 overcharges. LinkedIn said more than 90% of the overcharges were less than $25, and that it provided credits to virtually all affected advertisers. In their lawsuit, the advertisers said the overcharges left them with less money to spend elsewhere, including on ads. They are seeking unspecified damages and restitution.

The search and advertising giant had asked the judge to compel Microsoft to turn over documents, citing its failure to comply with a subpoena, according to a court filing unsealed late Thursday. \"In terms of does this request meet the general definition of relevancy? The answer is yes,\" said Judge Amit Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia at a hearing on Friday. Google served a subpoena to Microsoft more than three months ago, seeking documents regarding Microsoft's Bing search engine as well as its Internet Explorer and Edge but has not received them, the filing said. Google says some of the documents might shed light on whether Microsoft was actually restrained from competing with Google, or whether it simply failed to compete successfully. \"In particular, there are nineteen Microsoft employees who held important positions relating to activities at the core of this case but whose files Microsoft refuses to commit to search at this time,\" Google said in the filing. Google's search engine is the market leader by far while Bing's share is in single digits. Google also has a browser, Chrome. Microsoft, also in a filing late on Thursday, said Google's additional requests brings the total number of custodians, whose files Microsoft will have to search, to 55. According to Google, these executives covered issues at the core of the case, including the development and distribution of Microsoft's various search engines, Microsoft's search advertising business, and Microsoft's effort to market devices that would give it more search access points beyond the Windows desktop. The Justice Department sued Google in October, kicking off a spate of federal and state antitrust lawsuits against both Google and Facebook Inc  .

Shares ticked up 0.7% after Microsoft projected that growth in its Azure cloud computing business will continue apace following a quarter in which sales climbed 51%. Overall revenue rose 21% to $46.2 billion, beating analysts' consensus by about $2 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The pandemic-driven shift to remote work has boosted consumer appetite for cloud-based computing, helping companies including Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc's   cloud unit and Alphabet Inc's   Google Cloud. Microsoft's \"guidance was off-the-charts strong and it shows the cloud growth story in Redmond is hitting its next gear,\" said Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities. Revenue in Microsoft's \"Intelligent Cloud\" segment rose 30% to $17.4 billion, with growth in Azure revenues handily surpassing the 43.1% jump projected by analysts, according to consensus data from Visible Alpha. Microsoft's market capitalization stands at nearly $2.2 trillion, after climbing nearly 30% so far this year, compared with 18% for the overall S&P 500 Index  , according to Refinitiv Eikon data based on Monday's closing price. It has surpassed the price-to-earnings ratios of tech titans Apple Inc    and Google, fueling concerns among some analysts that it may be overvalued. \"Microsoft's stock has made a big run since the beginning of the pandemic, and is trading at rich multiples,\" said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing.com. \"After such a powerful rally, its shares may take a breather, especially when investors are still unclear how the demand scenario will evolve in the post-pandemic environment.\" Revenue from personal computing, which includes Windows software and Xbox gaming consoles, rose 9% to $14.1 billion. But Xbox content and services revenue dipped, suggesting that a pandemic-fueled gaming boom is beginning to wane, said Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight. The company must strengthen its presence in the home to better compete with rivals, he added. As makers of cars to smartphones grapple with an unprecedented chip shortage, Microsoft has not been immune. \"OEM revenue declined 3% and Surface declined 20%,\" Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said on a call with analysts. She added that \"both were impacted by the significant supply constraints noted earlier in a good demand environment.\" The chip shortage could also be contributing to Microsoft's dip in Xbox content and services revenue, as constrained hardware sales lead to a weaker performance in services, Ives said. \"If there's any lagging part of Microsoft, it's the consumer piece,\" he said. \"I think that continues to be a work in progress.\" Microsoft projected strong growth for professional social network LinkedIn, which benefited during the quarter from robust advertising and a strengthening job market. The company reported earnings of $2.17 per share, above the consensus estimate of $1.92.
